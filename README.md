# DSR_MiniProject
This is an example of a mini project completed during my time in the Data Science in Education Using R workgroup. This assignment was guided by the PDF located in the repository and data provided by the instructor. 

Here, you will find examples of data cleaning as well as univariate and bivariate analyses, ultimately leading to the construction of a linear model.
